    <p>Two Northvolt colleagues and I have collaborated on a blog post that describes the high-level design of the Northvolt cloud environment in Amazon Web Services (AWS). We introduce the concept of Cloud Factory Modules and explain how they are used to design and build a scalable platform for multiple large connected factories. The full blog post is published as part of <em>AWS for Industries</em> and can be found here: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/industries/northvolts-next-gen-connected-factory-a-digital-blueprint-factory-built-from-scratch/">Northvolt’s next-gen connected factory—a digital blueprint factory built from scratch</a>.</p>
