We introduce the concept of Cloud Factory Modules and explain how they are used to design and build a scalable platform for multiple large connected factories. The full blog post is published as part of “AWS for Industries” and can be found here: Northvolt’s next-gen connected factory—a digital blueprint factory built from scratch.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">10% of income to most effective charities</title><link href="https://ulmefors.com/effective-atruism/charity/philantropy/2022/01/20/ten-percent-of-income-to-most-effective-charities.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="10% of income to most effective charities" /><published>2022-01-20T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2022-01-20T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://ulmefors.com/effective-atruism/charity/philantropy/2022/01/20/ten-percent-of-income-to-most-effective-charities</id><author><name></name></author><category term="effective-atruism" /><category term="charity" /><category term="philantropy" /><summary type="html">This month, January 2022, I have made the decision to donate 10% of my income (definition) to the most effective charities as defined by GiveWell research and data.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Perspective published in Joule</title><link href="https://ulmefors.com/lithium-ion/battery-science/northvolt/imperial-college-london/mit/nrel/tsinghua/2020/12/28/joule-perspective.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Perspective published in Joule" /><published>2020-12-28T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2020-12-28T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://ulmefors.com/lithium-ion/battery-science/northvolt/imperial-college-london/mit/nrel/tsinghua/2020/12/28/joule-perspective</id><author><name></name></author><category term="lithium-ion" /><category term="battery-science" /><category term="northvolt" /><category term="imperial-college-london" /><category term="mit" /><category term="nrel" /><category term="tsinghua" /><summary type="html">I am delighted to have been part of a team writing a forward-looking Perspective on the future of data-driven Li-ion battery research with focus on improved safety.
