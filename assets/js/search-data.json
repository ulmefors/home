            "content": "For the 31 March 2022 I was invited by Dalarna Science Park to talk about how Northvolt can have an impact on innovation in the region. I shared information about the plans for the announced factory in Kvarnsveden outside Borl√§nge, Dalarna, as well as other factories in Sweden and Germany. . In the dialogue with the Dalarna Science Park CEO, Angelica Ekholm, we discussed key factors for a successful innovation ecosystem in the region such as renewable energy, sustainable logistics, and openness to diverse talent. . The full video production is available on YouTube (here) where my part starts at eight minutes (direct link). .",

            "content": "This month, January 2022, I have made the decision to donate 10% of my income (definition) to the most effective charities as defined by GiveWell research and data. . After some years of making donations to a range of well-known and respected charities, I have recently decided to take a more deliberate approach when selecting recipient organizations. Effectiveness as measured by impact per dollar varies greatly between organizations which means choosing charities carefully makes a big difference for everyone who wishes to do the most good with their donations. . Imaginge saving a child from drowning. That experience will likely be a defining moment for the rest of your life. It takes an estimated $4,500 to save a life (source) through donations to the most effective charities. That sounds like a lot. However, if you take home in excess of $25,000/year in net income and donate 10% to recommended charities, you‚Äôll save one life every other year for the rest of your working life. That‚Äôs incredible impact, and very achievable for working people in wealthy countries. . Multiple people have inspired me to make this decision, and perhaps I will inspire someone to do the same in the future. An important inspirational voice for me and others is that of Will MacAskill, Associate Professor in Philosophy at University of Oxford. Will is the author of the book Doing Good Better - Effective Altruism and a Radical New Way to Make a Difference, which I warmly recommend. .",

The full text can be accessed at The Application of Data-Driven Methods and Physics-Based Learning for Improving Battery Safety. . One of the most intriguing sections (Practical Implementation for Commercial Applications) takes inspiration from the field of robotics and automation research where a neural network is used to combine data from simulation and real-world experiments to achieve high accuracy with comparatively small datasets.
