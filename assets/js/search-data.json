            "content": "I am delighted to have been part of a team writing a forward-looking Perspective on the future of data-driven Li-ion battery research with focus on improved safety. The Perspective was a collaboration with co-authors from NREL, MIT, Tsinghua, and Imperial College and is now available in the academic journal Joule. The full text can be accessed at The Application of Data-Driven Methods and Physics-Based Learning for Improving Battery Safety. . One of the most intriguing sections (Practical Implementation for Commercial Applications) takes inspiration from the field of robotics and automation research where a neural network is used to combine data from simulation and real-world experiments to achieve high accuracy with comparatively small datasets. Further resources for a deeper dive into this approach1 is available through the KTH twitter account. .

This talk builds upon the 20 April 2017 Behavioral Cloning talk and focuses on improving neural network performance. The recording is now available to watch on YouTube. . . Description . How do we achieve high performance Neural Networks for Self-Driving Cars? We will consider frequently encountered obstacles and proven solutions. This event builds on the Behavorial Cloning presentation from 20 April 2017 and will be more technical. We will explain data manipulation, neural network tricks, and computer vision to unlock better performance without collecting more data. This presentation will be friendly but may contain mathematics and code. You have been warned! .",

What are Convolutional Neural Networks and why are they popular in Deep Learning image recognition applications? We will compare modern Neural Networks to ‚Äúclassic‚Äù Machine Learning methods and thereby understand Behavioral Cloning. We will use Behavorial Cloning to teach a car to drive itself by copying human driver behavior. Don‚Äôt worry, we‚Äôll drive in a simulator. Safety first! .",
