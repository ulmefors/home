            "content": "On 10 December 2019 I was invited to Imperial College London to give a talk on Northvolt‚Äôs progress so far, and what‚Äôs in store for the future. The title was Giga-Scale European Li-ion Manufacture: Bold bets, deep analytics, sustainable by design. The session was jointly hosted by Energy Futures Lab and Dyson School of Design Engineering. The recording is now available on YouTube. . .",

            "content": "On 9 May 2017 I was invited to Foo Caf√© Malm√∂ to give a second talk on Machine Learning for Self-Driving Cars. This talk builds upon the 20 April 2017 Behavioral Cloning talk and focuses on improving neural network performance. The recording is now available to watch on YouTube. . . Description . How do we achieve high performance Neural Networks for Self-Driving Cars? We will consider frequently encountered obstacles and proven solutions. This event builds on the Behavorial Cloning presentation from 20 April 2017 and will be more technical. We will explain data manipulation, neural network tricks, and computer vision to unlock better performance without collecting more data. This presentation will be friendly but may contain mathematics and code. You have been warned! .",

This talk focuses on Behavioral Cloning and the recording is now available to watch on YouTube. There is a follow-up video from the 9 May 2017 Neural Network performance talk. . . Description . What are Convolutional Neural Networks and why are they popular in Deep Learning image recognition applications? We will compare modern Neural Networks to ‚Äúclassic‚Äù Machine Learning methods and thereby understand Behavioral Cloning. We will use Behavorial Cloning to teach a car to drive itself by copying human driver behavior. Don‚Äôt worry, we‚Äôll drive in a simulator. Safety first! .",
