            "content": "I was invited to give an in-person presentation at re:Invent 2023 on how Northvolt leverages Amazon Web Services (AWS) to scale Li-ion Battery Gigafactories. With me on stage was Karthik Krishnamurthy (Business Development Leader, Manufacturing &amp; Sustainability at AWS) who highlighted the importance of digital manufacturing. . The session covers key components of the Northvolt Connected Factory architecture, including IoT Platform, Cloud MES, Traceability, Interactive Operations, and Data Platform. The concept and design principles of Cloud Factory Modules are introduced as the foundation for our scalability vision. . The full video production is available on YouTube where my part starts at 11:52 (direct link). . Description . Northvolt aims to become Europe’s largest producer of sustainable battery solutions and gigafactories. Northvolt uses AWS for its “Platform” initiative, which includes their Connected Factory and Battery Systems cloud platforms, as well as hosting their PLM system. Their factory blueprint harnesses technology, data, and automation across their factory operations (such as production lines, IT, etc.) to enable a “factory as code” solution to speed the deployment of new facilities as they rapidly expand. Northvolt has also used advanced analytics, simulation techniques, and applied AI on the production line. Learn how Northvolt has improved productivity and quality while reducing time to market. .",

The full video production is available on YouTube where my part starts at 32:14 (direct link). . Description . Designing the factories of the future involves embracing two themes that innovative organizations often prioritize—a cloud-native design and a bias for sustainability. Modern manufacturers are using AWS to model and optimize factory operations and deliver lower-impact products. In this session, learn how battery manufacturer Northvolt manages their factories as digital assets, activating detailed traceability, near real-time monitoring, and machine learning modeling to improve battery quality. Using serverless and open-source frameworks for their digital twins, Northvolt continues to speed innovation and reduce the resources required to produce batteries that support the transition to a decarbonized future. .",

            "content": "This month, January 2022, I have made the decision to donate 10% of my income (definition) to the most effective charities as defined by GiveWell research and data. . After some years of making donations to a range of well-known and respected charities, I have recently decided to take a more deliberate approach when selecting recipient organizations. Effectiveness as measured by impact per dollar varies greatly between organizations which means choosing charities carefully makes a big difference for everyone who wishes to do the most good with their donations. . Imaginge saving a child from drowning. That experience will likely be a defining moment for the rest of your life. It takes an estimated $4,500 to save a life (source) through donations to the most effective charities. That sounds like a lot. However, if you take home in excess of $25,000/year in net income and donate 10% to recommended charities, you’ll save one life every other year for the rest of your working life. That’s incredible impact, and very achievable for working people in wealthy countries. . Multiple people have inspired me to make this decision, and perhaps I will inspire someone to do the same in the future. An important inspirational voice for me and others is that of Will MacAskill, Associate Professor in Philosophy at University of Oxford. Will is the author of the book Doing Good Better - Effective Altruism and a Radical New Way to Make a Difference, which I warmly recommend. . .",

            "content": "On 10 December 2019 I was invited to Imperial College London to give a talk on Northvolt’s progress so far, and what’s in store for the future. The title was Giga-Scale European Li-ion Manufacture: Bold bets, deep analytics, sustainable by design. The session was jointly hosted by Energy Futures Lab and Dyson School of Design Engineering. The recording is available on YouTube. . Description . Energy Futures Lab and the Dyson School of Design Engineering present a lecture from Marcus Ulmefors a Data Scientist focussed on battery modeling at Northvolt. . Does Europe need a homegrown Li-ion Gigafactory? We believe it does. With the dramatic increase of renewable energy deployment and electric vehicle production, the timing is perfect for Giga-scale Li-ion manufacture in Europe. In fact, with the current global outlook, we cannot move quickly enough. . This talk will explain the rationale behind Northvolt (founded 2016), its approach on Li-ion technology, sustainable manufacture, digitalization, and recycling. During fall 2019, Northvolt started construction of its first factory with final potential manufacture capacity of 40 GWh/year in Skellefteå, Sweden. In parallel, a joint venture with Volkswagen has been announced to build a second factory in Germany. . Marcus Ulmefors graduated from Imperial College (MEng in Mechanical Engineering) in 2012 and now works with Data Science and Battery Modeling at Northvolt in Stockholm. Prior to this role, the most recent activity was large fleet Li-ion battery analysis of connected off-grid Solar Home Systems in East Africa. . Marcus combines engineering experience of energy system technologies (batteries, solar, wind, ocean waves, nuclear fission) with professional experience in data science, machine learning and software development in applying both theoretical and data-driven methods to the study of Li-ion behaviour. .",
