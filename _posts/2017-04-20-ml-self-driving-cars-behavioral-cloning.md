On 20 April 2017 I was invited to [Foo Café Malmö](https://foocafe.org/) to give a talk on Machine Learning for Self-Driving Cars. This talk focuses on Behavioral Cloning and the recording is now available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmdVVFj3SaA). There is a follow-up video from the [9 May 2017 Neural Network performance talk]({% post_url 2017-05-09-ml-self-driving-cars-neural-network-performance %}).

**Description**

*What are Convolutional Neural Networks and why are they popular in Deep Learning image recognition applications? We will compare modern Neural Networks to "classic" Machine Learning methods and thereby understand Behavioral Cloning. We will use Behavorial Cloning to teach a car to drive itself by copying human driver behavior. Don't worry, we'll drive in a simulator. Safety first!*
