Two Northvolt colleagues and I have collaborated on a blog post that describes the high-level design of the Northvolt cloud environment in Amazon Web Services (AWS). We introduce the concept of Cloud Factory Modules and explain how they are used to design and build a scalable platform for multiple large connected factories. The full blog post is published at AWS and can be found here: [https://](https://).
