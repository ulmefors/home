title: Dalarna Science Park talk on Northvolt regional innovation impact
---

For the 31 March 2022 I was invited by Dalarna Science Park to talk about how Northvolt can have an impact on innovation in the region. I shared information about the plans for the announced factory in Kvarnsveden outside Borl√§nge, Dalarna, as well as other factories in Sweden and Germany.

In the dialogue with the Dalarna Science Park CEO, Angelica Ekholm, we discussed key factors for a successful innovation ecosystem in the region such as renewable energy, sustainable logistics, and openness to diverse talent.

The full video production is available on YouTube ([here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrRu_JChiZY)) where my part starts at eight minutes ([direct link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrRu_JChiZY&t=490s)).
