I am thankful to have been part of a team writing a Perspective on the future of data-driven battery research with focus on improved safety. The result of this team effort is now published in the academic journal Joule and can be accessed <u>here</u>.

One of the parts that intrigue me the most takes inspiration from the field of robotics and automation research where a neural network is used to combine data from simulation and real-world experiments to achieve high accuracy with comparatively small datasets. Further resources for a deeper dive into this approach[^1] is available through the KTH twitter account.
