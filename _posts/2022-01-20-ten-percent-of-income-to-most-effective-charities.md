title: 10% of income to most effective charities
---

This month, January 2022, I have made the decision to donate 10% of my income [(definition)](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge/#how-do-you-define-income) to the most effective charities as defined by [GiveWell](https://www.givewell.org) research and data.

After some years of making donations to a range of well-known and respected charities, I have recently decided to take a more deliberate approach when selecting recipient organizations. Effectiveness as measured by impact per dollar varies greatly between organizations which means choosing charities carefully makes a big difference for everyone who wishes to do the most good with their donations.

Multiple people have inspired me to make this decision, and perhaps I will inspire someone to do the same in the future. An important inspirational voice for me and others is that of [Will MacAskill](https://www.williammacaskill.com), Associate Professor in Philosophy at University of Oxford. Will is the author of the book
[Doing Good Better - Effective Altruism and a Radical New Way to Make a Difference](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Doing-Good-Better-Effective-Difference/dp/1783350512/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1536156440&sr=8-1&keywords=doing+good+better), which I warmly recommend.
