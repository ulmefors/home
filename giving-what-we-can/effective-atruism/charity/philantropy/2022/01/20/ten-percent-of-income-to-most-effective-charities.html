    <p>This month, January 2022, I have made the decision to donate 10% of my income (<a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge/#how-do-you-define-income">definition</a>) to the most effective charities as defined by <a href="https://www.givewell.org">GiveWell</a> research and data.</p>

<p>After some years of making donations to a range of well-known and respected charities, I have recently decided to take a more deliberate approach when selecting recipient organizations. Effectiveness as measured by impact per dollar varies greatly between organizations which means choosing charities carefully makes a big difference for everyone who wishes to do the most good with their donations.</p>

<p>Imaginge saving a child from drowning. That experience will likely be a defining moment for the rest of your life. It takes an estimated $4,500 to save a life (<a href="https://www.givewell.org/cost-to-save-a-life">source</a>) through donations to the most effective charities. That sounds like a lot. However, if you take home in excess of $25,000/year in net income and donate 10% to recommended charities, you’ll save one life every other year for the rest of your working life. That’s incredible impact, and very achievable for working people in wealthy countries.</p>

<p>Multiple people have inspired me to make this decision, and perhaps I will inspire someone to do the same in the future. An important inspirational voice for me and others is that of <a href="https://www.williammacaskill.com">Will MacAskill</a>, Associate Professor in Philosophy at University of Oxford. Will is the author of the book
<a href="https://www.williammacaskill.com/book">Doing Good Better - Effective Altruism and a Radical New Way to Make a Difference</a>, which I warmly recommend.</p>
